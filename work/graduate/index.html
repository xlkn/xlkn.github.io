 </p>
<p>After considering the colour and font choices for the logo, I decided on lato for the font and a colour palette made up of shades of mute red, greys and black.</p>
<p>Which follow the SRC brand guidelines, these colours I choose portray the underlaying meaning and style of the logo. Additionally, red has been found to stimulate appetite and highlight the word graduate bringing attention toward the name. Yet not over power current SRC branding.</p>

<h3 id="design-implementation-and-outcome">Design Implementation and Outcome</h3>
<p>Overall, I was delighted the concept and design really added value to the client and overall branding throughout the restaurant. It was a pretty special moment having previously trained in professional cookery in the kitchen that served the restaurant. To then have the chance to use skills I learnt as I progressed in a different field to give back in different capacity.</p>
