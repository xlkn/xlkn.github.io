                <p>In the following blog post, I am going walk through several of the steps I took to start learning about static analysis for windows malware using both samclass.info and the Practical Malware Analysis book. The examples below are from the books exercise materials. The tools vary to the book recommendations as I found others that speed up the process.</p>
<p>Lab01-02.exe – Packed exe. To start, I ran the sample through detect-it-easy which indicated that the sample was packed with UPX.</p>

    <figure class="center" >
        <img src="/img/LearningStatic/DIE.png"  alt="strings screenshot"   />

        
    </figure>


<p>I then ran the sample through strings.py. A python program built to work much like the strings command on Linux. Below you can that it references UPX and a small number of imports common with packed samples. From this, you can get clues to what is looking to do without unpacking it. For example, Wininet and InternetOpenA. Is related to the sample using internet API on windows to open communication with C&amp;C server.</p>

<p>The next step was to unpacked the sample with UPX.</p>

<p>Finally, I put the unpacked sample into pe-studio where we can see additional information below on the sample, in this case, it makes a call out to <a href="http://www.malwareanalysisbook.com">http://www.malwareanalysisbook.com</a></p>
