      <description>This project came about after I was learning about image classification from fast.ai&amp;rsquo;s online course. The course started by learning to classify cats and dogs images, this was cool at the time but then my mind shifted to can this be used to classify malware and how? The simple answer, yes, but finding a dataset with benign images now that was a problem. So in this write-up, I will show the steps I took while i started to build a dataset with benign greyscale images using windows executables.</description>
