      <description>During the Covid-19 lockdown, I took the time to get familiar with both mobile development and the Kotlin programming language.

I wanted to challenge myself with an API I wasn&amp;rsquo;t familiar with so that I would have to read the developers documents and put in the time to make it work error by error.</description>
